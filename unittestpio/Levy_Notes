This file should be deleted before copying the unittestpio directory onto the trunk.

Issues to deal with:

1) Can not suppress MPI-IO warning message if file does not exist.

"open_mpiio: after call to MPI_file_open:MPI_ERR_NO_SUCH_FILE: no such file or directory"

2) Can not open a binary file with PIO_write and put data in it.

"write_mpiio_int: after call to file_write_all:MPI_ERR_READ_ONLY: file is read only
pio_support::pio_die:: myrank=          -1 : ERROR: iompi_mod.F90:         230 : (no message)"

3) When "creating" a binary file that already exists with PIO_CLOBBER
   (which is ignored), file is not emptied.

"warning, the mode argument is currently ignored for binary file operations"

4) When creating a binary file to write data using PIO_iotype_direct_pbinary,
   file is 32767 times larger than same file written with PIO_iotype_pbinary
